# London Bikes Analysis

# Overview
This project focuses on the process of data manipulation and visualization, offering valuable insights into bike-sharing trends in London. The analysis highlights patterns in bike usage influenced by factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and seasonal changes. By exploring this dataset, the Tableau dashboard provides an intuitive and interactive way to understand the performance metrics of London’s bike-sharing service, which can help inform strategic decisions and operational improvements.

# Features
The Tableau dashboard showcases a variety of visualizations designed to uncover meaningful trends in the data. An hourly analysis chart breaks down bike usage by time of day, revealing peak and off-peak hours. Weather conditions, including temperature and wind speed, are analyzed through visualizations like a heatmap to illustrate their impact on bike-sharing activity. A 20-day moving average graph tracks usage trends over time, offering a clearer picture of long-term patterns. The dashboard also includes a total rides analysis, presenting the cumulative bike usage across the timeline, and additional charts that delve into the relationship between environmental factors and ride behavior.

# Data Sources
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Transport for London (TfL) and includes metadata such as timestamps, hourly bike counts, weather conditions (temperature, wind speed, and weather codes), and contextual information like holidays, weekends, and seasonal classifications. This rich dataset serves as the foundation for analyzing various aspects of London’s bike-sharing trends.

# Usage
The project involves preprocessing and manipulating the raw data to ensure it is clean and structured for visualization. Once prepared, the Tableau dashboard provides an accessible way to explore the insights. Users can navigate through the interactive dashboard, filter data, and adjust parameters to uncover specific patterns or focus on particular aspects of the analysis. The visualizations are designed to help identify trends and correlations in bike-sharing usage, offering both high-level overviews and detailed insights.
